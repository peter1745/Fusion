## Contributing Features
Generally speaking I won't be accepting feature implementations since I want to implement the majority of features myself. This is mainly a learning project for me, and it's pretty pointless if others start adding massive features for me ðŸ™‚

## Contributing Bug Fixes
I'm happy to accept any bug fixes, so long as they're not pointless

## Feature Requests / Suggestions
Feature requests and suggestions are always welcome, feel free to open an issue with your suggestion / request ðŸ™‚
